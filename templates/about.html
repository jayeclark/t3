                <h4>Hi, I'm Jay Clark! ðŸ‘‹ </h4>
                <p>I built this app to provide a quick & simple way to practice coding trivia and regular expressions. It's made with python, Flask, and SQLite and pulls its questions from the public <a href="https://quizapi.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Quiz API</a> resource.
                </p>
                <p>I'm a career-transitioning full-stack developer focusing on React & Express. Iâ€™ve contributed code to 70+ Open Source Software projects and have gained real-life experience in several additional stacks through those efforts.
                </p>
                <p>My previous experience includes running a talent management business for gaming content creators, working in management consulting, and teaching at Harvard & MIT. I received my AB <i>magna cum laude</i> from Harvard, where my thesis on internet culture was nominated for a Hoopes Prize.
                </p>
                <p>In my spare time, I enjoy traveling, volunteering for my neighborhood cat rescue org, and cultivating my amateur chef & food photographer skills.
